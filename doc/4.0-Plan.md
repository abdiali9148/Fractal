# CS 1440 Project 4.0: Software Development Plan

Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `4.0-analyzed`)
--------------------------------------------------------
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the starter code in this phase.**  Feel free to write prototype files and experiment in the REPL, but it's too early to work on the starter code now.


Deliver:

*   [ ] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
         *   First thing i have to do it rewrite the code to make it very simple.
         *   Preserve the existing functionality. Just refactor the code so more stuff can be easily added later. 
*   [ ] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
         *  A good Solution is when the code is very easy to read and the program has the same functionality.
    *   List what you already know how to do.
         *  I already know how python works so i think i can easily manipulate the code to make it easy to read
    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
         *  Some challenges i can already see is how badly the code is written. I think i have to sit and see how it all comes together.
*   [ ] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
         *  The Program takes a minimum and a maximum of 1 file. It has to draw it and i just tried that it only takes one file.
*   [ ] Explain what form the program's output will take.
  *     python src/program data/file
    *  Fractal files that have either p or phoenix work well with phoenix_fractal.py
    *  Fractal files that have either m or mandel work well with mbrot_fractal.py
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-analyzed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed by 11:59 PM on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*
    

Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.0-designed`)
-----------------------------------------
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the starter code in this phase.**  Feel free to write prototype files and experiment in the REPL, but it's too early to work on the starter code now.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works in plain language.
    *   Starting from each function, im gonna point out whats wrong with it and how i can fix it
    *   Starting with `mbrot_fractal.py`
      *  First fishy thing i see are all the Classs of the colors. 
         *  if the pallete already has colors, I dont need the classes.
         * there are also many colors in the palette that arent even used.
        * There are many function that are useless. all of the functions are named badly
        *  Ill name pixelsWrittenSoFar `status_bar`
            * global SIZE looks like it doesnt do anything so i removed it.
            * the variable pixels isn't used so i just removed it.
            * There is unused code so i removed that too.
            * In the return function. it says join(list[]). but [] is already is a list.
        * Ill name PixelColorOrIndex `pixel_color`. I used chat gpt to help explain this function
            * the global variables are useless
            * There are 3 big if statements. Maybe i can collapse them into one.
              * the import statement builtins.len is simply the function len()
              * the second if statement seems to not affect anything but the unit tests.
            * to collapse them, i will make palette=None in the parameters
              * num_colors for the length of the palette and change the range to range(num_colors)
        ```python
            if the pallete is not none:
                number of colors is the lenth of the pallete
                for every iteration in the range of num_colors:
                    create z
                    if the absolute value of z is greater than an two(escape value):
                        return pallete(num_colors - 1)
            else:
                for every iteration in the range of the max iterations:
                    create z
                    if absolute value of z is greater than 2 (escape radius):
                        return iteration
                return max iterations - 1
        ```
        * I'll name PaintTheFractalsPixelsIntoTkinterWindow **paint_fractal**
          * i decided to make the varibales palette, img, and SIZE parameters.
          * I renamed all the poorly named variables.
          * made a variable for "complex(x, y)"
          *  512 is a magic number. i put SIZE where it all is. 
          *  the if statement "if imagename in 'leaf'" is not being used. so i removed it.
        ```python
            make a half axis variable equal to fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0
            subract it from minimum of x
            add it to maximum of x
            subract it from minimum of y
            
            make a row of colors list.
        
            for i in the range of the total pixels
                row is equla to size - (i remainder of size)
                
                x is the sum of the min of x, columns, and the pixel size
                y is the sum of the min of y, columns, and the pixel size
                make the complexs numbers a variable called point
                define the color with pixel_color with the parameters point and palette
                add color to row of colors list
        
                if the collumn is equal to the size - 1
                    img.put
                    update the window.
                    print the updated pixels
        ```
            
           * im gonna name castMbrotDataFileToHashMap 'cast_hash_map'
             * i put the NAME variable in this function because its only relevant here
             *  "for num, line in numerate(f)" returns a tuple but it works just as fine as "line in f:"
             * this whole if statement 'if len(kv) != 2:' is useless
             * the print statements inside elif kv[0] == "type" and kv[1] != "mandelbrot": are also useless
             * the try and except statements are useless so i brought the if statements down and got 
               * rid of the except statement
             * every statement at the end beside this "return tuple([Path(fname).stem, frac])" is useless.
             *  the hard part was getting to refactor the first 8 lines
               * frac gets defined then it gets defined again making it redundant.
                 * i decided to combine it into one.
               * i can take out all of the f.close because they are not important
             ```python
                for every line in the file
                    if line is a new line or it starts with #(colors)
                        then continue
                    declare the key, value variable that splits by a semicolon. ex(key is centerx, value is .5)
                    split kv into two values.
                    if key is equal to centerx
                        the fractal of centerX is the value of float value
                     if key is equal to centery
                        the fractal of centerY is the value of float value
                     if key is equal to axislength
                        the fractal of axisLen is the value of float value
                     if key is equal to 'type' and is not the value of mandelbrot
                        the fractal of type is the value of string value
                return the tuple
             ```
             * mbrotMainFunc. I decided to just name this __main__ because at the end of the file
               * def __main__():
                 return main()
                 def main():
                 mbrotMainFunc()
               * these 2 functions are redundant when mbrotMainFunc already does the job.
               * this is useless. '# return 1'
               * name = nom is redundant.
               * The hard part for me was somehow figuring out how to get rid of global img
                 * I just added img as a parameter to PaintTheFractalsPixelsIntoTkinterWindow 
               * many other things were redundant so i just removed them.
    * NOW FOR PHOENIX_FRACTAL.PY
      * first thing i did was clean up all of the useless imports.
        * I imported Path from pathlib so its better looking
        * SPC = chr(0o40) is just a space character so ill remove that.
        * s = 0o1000 is 512. imma name this SIZE
        * getColorFromPalette. c is the only parameter needed
          * both the global variables are useless
          * the variable c = complex(fc['creal'], fc['cimag']) was defined right above but it was commented out
            * the numbers are.  complex(0.5667, 0.0)
            * chat gpt also confirmed those are the numbers
            * same thing for pheonix = complex(fc['preal'], fc['pimag'])
              * phoenix had a typo so i fixed that.
          * i removed the last return statement
        * getFractalConfigurationDataFromFractalRepositoryDictionary
          * looks for n in the dictionary d and returns its value. if not found return false. 
            * `if n is in d, return d of n. if not return false`
        * I added the status_bar from mbrot_fractal.py because it wasnt in it.
        * I took a lot of code from the other paint_fractal.
          * the same half axis minimums and maximums.
          * i wanted to make it very similiar so i can call them in the same main.py module.
        * cast_hash_map
          * im going to copy most of the parts from mbrot_fractal because i wanted to have them be in the same file 'parser'
          * the only problem is that in mbrot was that it already had the key and value
            * this file has a pair. but its very hard for me to split it into with all the if statements.
              * im gonna do the same as the other cast_hash_map
        * main function.
          * i just copied the other main function.



*   [ ] Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   As you think of specific examples, write them under **Phase 3** so you can run them as soon as the program is functional.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*


Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.0-implemented`)
----------------------------------------------------
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Working code in the `src/` folder.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   The once thing that i spent the most time while implementing was trying to make most of the filees the exact same
      * making it the same same enabled me to split them into different modules.
      * especially the main function. this was the first one i was able to make fully the same
      *     the next being cast_hash_map
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-implemented` and push it to GitLab.


Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `4.0-tested`)
------------------------------------------------------
*(30% of your effort)*

Your grade depends on how your program performs when run from the command line.  We don't use PyCharm to grade, so ensure your program runs correctly from the shell.

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   The hardest part is getting the functions into different modules while importing them.
      * i screwed up so bad once i had to re download the file.
      * One easy part was adding an if statement into main.py 
      *     saying if the first argument in mbrot then use mbrot_paint_fractal.
      *     if else use phoenix_paint_fractal.
    * the easiest way that worked for me was starting simple and relocating one file at at time.
      * I kept running it after every file i moved then imported.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-tested` and push it to GitLab.


Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.0-deployed`)
---------------------------------------------
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-deployed` and push it to GitLab.
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Look for all of the tags in the **Tags** tab.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


Phase 5: Maintenance
--------------------

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Project Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
